        Zillow defines a "single-family home" as "a standalone, detached house used as a single dwelling unit, meaning a residence for one family, person or household. It has its own private entrance and direct street access, and is built on its own land, usually with additional yard space."

        Zillow data was incomplete for several states, and as such there will be zero values for the incomplete years.
