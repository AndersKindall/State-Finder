https://anderskindall.github.io/State-Finder/

BACKGROUND

As housing prices in the Bay Area and the rest of California continue to rise, a question that pops up is "If I were to leave the state, which state would I want to move to?" State Finder - What's the Damage? shows the mean prices for single-family homes by state by year using a bar graph.  The yearly data allows users to view trends throughout the years and anticipate market shifts.
